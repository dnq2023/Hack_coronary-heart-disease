Detect coronary heart disease using glucose and lipid data.

Juiena:
coronary heart disease would be a good option to choose for our project as it is normally detected through physical exams and finding a better detection method will be more innovative hopefully. 

The wearable device (bracelet) and integrate an optical NIR spectroscopy for glucose and lipid detection (dual sensory system) both play a key role in causing coronary heart disease (with plaque buildup..). NIR spectroscopy is a topic of active research right now..so this is something new not yet available on the market. It’s user friendly, non invasive, good for continuous monitoring and easily accessible. This device will be connected to a mobile app as we discussed before. This time only 2 things will be monitored glucose and lipid levels so less problem with memory…and AI will be used to send notifications based on patterns
