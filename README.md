# Hack_heart-disease

Developer: HeartTech Pioneers

Detect coronary heart disease using PCG and ECG

Model Description: "Easy to Difficult" Model; Start by using a computationally friendly and simple model for predictions (a model deployed on portable devices), without worrying about false positives. After the simple model detects a positive result, a deep learning model can be used for further assessment (where patient data is uploaded for cloud computing or automatically uploaded via networked devices).

"HeartWave" is the main function(You can divide some subfunction out from it to make it simplified)
